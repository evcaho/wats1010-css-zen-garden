Design Concepts
=============

My design concept was based on a lot of the websites I spend a lot of time on and enjy visually. A lot of these sites are content-heavy, like [The slog](http://thestranger.com/slog), [Medium](http://www.medium.com), and personal or portfolio sites like [Weybec's](http://www.weybec.com/about-us/), [Aminatou Sow's website](http://aminatou.com/) and [Avvo.com](http://www.avvo.com). 

Because of their purpose, they rely on scrolling and ususally employ one large image or text-as-image at top. These sites have simple color schemes - black and white or with one accent color - and use a lot of white space. These sites use sans serif fonts, sometimes center headlines, and divide the page into horizontal boxes. Several of the sites I listed as examples also divide up three sections into one vertical box containing three sub-sections. It's a way to break up the scrolling and fit a lot of information into an easily-scannable size. I used this concept twice in my wireframes.

Design Concepts
=============

My design concept was based on a lot of the websites I spend a lot of time on and enjy visually. A lot of these sites are content-heavy, like the Slog, Medium, and personal or portfolio sites like http://www.weybec.com/about-us/, Aminatou Sow's website and Avvo.com. Because of their purpose, they rely on scrolling and ususally employ one large image or text-as-image at top. These sites use sans serif fonts, centered headlines, and divide the page into horizontal boxes. Several of the sites I listed as examples also divide up three sections into one vertical box containing three sub-sections. It's a way to break up the scrolling and fit a lot of information into an easily-scannable size. I used this concept twice in my wireframes.
